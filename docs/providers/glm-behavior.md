# :providers-zai: GLM Behavior

This page covers the toggles and options that control how IntenseRP interacts with **GLM Chat** (chat.z.ai).

!!! warning "Beta quality"
    The GLM driver is still somewhat beta-like. It is mostly usable for daily driving, but you may occasionally run into quirks or instability. For a deep dive into known quirks and timing settings, see [:material-wrench-clock: GLM Quirks](../advanced/glm-quirks.md).

---

## :material-call-split: Request Capture Mode

Controls how IntenseRP captures GLM's streaming response.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Request Capture Mode**

**Replay** is the default. IntenseRP intercepts the GLM request, replays it internally, streams that replay to the API client, and then gives the captured response back to the page. It's the older, known-good path.

**CDP Teeing** is the newer alternative. IntenseRP leaves GLM's real browser request alone, tees the real response through Chrome DevTools Protocol, and feeds those bytes through the same GLM stream parser. This lets the page JavaScript receive and process its own response normally while IntenseRP observes the stream.

!!! note "Default stays Replay"
    CDP Teeing is off by default for GLM. It's available if you want the browser-native request path, but Replay remains the safer default while this newer path gets more real-world mileage.

---

## :material-tune: Modes (model IDs)

In IntenseRP Next v2, the `model` you select in SillyTavern is mostly a **mode selector**, not a true model picker.

For GLM, these model IDs map to simple behavior presets:

| Model ID | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `glm-auto` | Uses your IntenseRP settings |
| `glm-chat` | Forces Deep Think **off** and never emits `<think>` |
| `glm-reasoner` | Forces Deep Think **on** (Send Deep Think follows your setting) |

!!! note "About real GLM model selection"
    IntenseRP can also switch GLM's *real* model picker in the web UI.

    :material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Model**

    The Settings dropdown shows the supported GLM web UI entries. Use it as the exact list, since GLM can change model availability through rollouts or maintenance.

    Right now, **GLM-5.2 and GLM-5.3** are the only models where IntenseRP exposes the separate **Deep Think Effort** setting, and **GLM-5V-Turbo** is the only model where IntenseRP exposes the separate **Enable Tools** toggle. On other GLM models, those settings are ignored or forced off as needed.

    !!! warning "Fallback behavior"
        If your selected model is not present in the dropdown (UI changes / rollout), IntenseRP logs a warning and selects the **first available** model instead.

---

## :material-head-cog: Deep Think

Deep Think is GLM's reasoning mode. When enabled, GLM produces an internal reasoning trace before (or alongside) the final answer.

### Enable Deep Think

Toggles the Deep Think button in GLM's interface.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Enable Deep Think**

### Deep Think Effort

GLM-5.2 and GLM-5.3 use a newer Deep Think control. Instead of one plain toggle, the menu has **High** and **Max** effort choices plus a separate on/off switch.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Deep Think Effort**

This setting is only shown for **GLM-5.2 or GLM-5.3** while **Enable Deep Think** is on. Older GLM models keep using the simpler Deep Think toggle.

### Send Deep Think

When enabled, IntenseRP includes GLM's reasoning in the response, wrapped in `<think>` tags.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Send Deep Think**

---

## :material-magnify: Search

GLM Chat Search can be toggled via IntenseRP.

GLM streams internal tool/search payloads into the same response stream (wrapped in `<glm_block>...</glm_block>`). IntenseRP strips these blocks, so search results are **not sent** to the client.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Enable Search**

### Advanced Search

GLM also has an **Advanced Search** switch tucked inside the Search hover menu. IntenseRP can toggle it too, but it is off by default and only applies when **Deep Think** and **Search** are both enabled for the request.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Enable Advanced Search**

!!! note "Dependency behavior"
    In Settings, **Enable Advanced Search** is forced off while **Enable Deep Think** or **Enable Search** is off.

    At runtime, IntenseRP also checks the resolved request settings. If a model ID, loadout, or request override asks for Advanced Search without both required modes, the driver logs a warning and sends the request without Advanced Search.

!!! note "Same output filtering"
    Advanced Search can make GLM search more deeply, but IntenseRP still strips GLM's internal search/tool payloads from the API stream. You may still see citations in the final answer.

---

## :material-wrench: Tools

Some GLM models now expose a separate **Tools** button next to **Search** and **Deep Think**.

IntenseRP supports that toggle too, but currently only on **GLM-5V-Turbo**. If you pick any other GLM model, **Enable Tools** is automatically forced off instead of pretending everything is fine and then wandering into the UI looking confused.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Enable Tools**

!!! warning "Very heavily recommended to leave off"
    Leave **Enable Tools** disabled unless you are intentionally poking at it.

    GLM's Tools UI is still unstable, and IntenseRP does **not** support those tool outputs yet. The toggle exists mostly so advanced users can experiment, not because this is a polished or recommended workflow.

!!! note "Separate from Search"
    **Enable Tools** is its own toggle. It does not replace **Enable Search**, and turning on one does not automatically turn on the other.

!!! note "Loadout-aware"
    This setting works with **Loadouts** just like the other GLM Behavior fields. If a loadout enables Tools but the selected GLM model does not support it, IntenseRP still forces it back off at runtime.

---

## :material-calculator: Count Tokens

GLM's backend reports token usage near the end of a response stream. When enabled, IntenseRP captures these values and returns them in the OpenAI-style `usage` fields (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`). This is enabled by default.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Count Tokens**

!!! note "Caching"
    Sometimes GLM reports cached prompt tokens as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.

---

## :material-file-upload: File Upload Mode

Instead of typing your message into GLM's chat box, IntenseRP can upload it as a text file attachment. This is useful for very long prompts that might hit input limits.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Send As Text File**

### File Upload Timeout

When uploading files, GLM can take a moment before the send button becomes active. This setting controls how long IntenseRP waits (in seconds) before giving up.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **File Upload Timeout**

Default is 15 seconds. Increase it if you're on a slow connection/PC or uploading very large prompts.

### Text File Filler

GLM won't let you send a file with an empty textbox as it needs *some* text alongside it. By default IntenseRP pastes a single `.` (dot) as filler, but you can change this to whatever you want.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Text File Filler**

This setting only appears when **Send As Text File** is enabled.

---

## :material-refresh: Reuse Matching Chat

Reuse Matching Chat tries to keep chats tidy: when you send the exact same prompt twice in a row, IntenseRP clicks GLM's "Regenerate" instead of creating a brand new chat. This is done with the goal of reducing clutter in the chat history and generally just speeding up the workflow.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Reuse Matching Chat**

!!! note "Pick one"
    On GLM, you can use either **Reuse Matching Chat** (+ optional **Search Older Matching Chats**) or **Repetition Buster**.

    They are opposite strategies, so IntenseRP only uses one of them at a time.

!!! warning "Known issue (GLM)"
    Reuse Matching Chat is currently unreliable with GLM Chat. The option may error out even though your request still completes normally.

    If you want to experiment with it anyway, try enabling **Refresh After Generation** under **Settings -> Provider Behavior -> GLM Chat -> Quirks**. This reloads the page after each response and can sometimes restore the UI state so Regenerate becomes available again.

!!! tip "Search Older Matching Chats"
    GLM also supports **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Search Older Matching Chats**.

    That lets IntenseRP keep up to 7 older cached GLM chats per account and try reopening one of those when the current prompt matches.

    Same point as above, though: if GLM's regenerate UI is being annoying that day, **Search Older Matching Chats** inherits the same annoyance because it still depends on the Regenerate button working.

### :material-shuffle-variant: Repetition Buster

Repetition Buster is basically the opposite of **Reuse Matching Chat**.

Instead of trying to reuse the same chat, IntenseRP checks whether the current prompt matches the **immediately previous** one for the active GLM account/profile. That last-prompt memory is kept across restarts, because GLM's own caching can survive them too. If it matches, IntenseRP opens a throwaway fresh chat, sends a random **128-character** string there, and then opens another fresh chat for your real prompt.

That random string is just a cache buster. The whole idea is to disturb GLM's context caching before the real request goes out, which can help if you're worried about suspiciously repetitive duplicate generations.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Repetition Buster**

!!! note "No Search Older Matching Chats here"
    **Search Older Matching Chats** only works with **Reuse Matching Chat**, because it reopens an older chat and presses **Regenerate** there.

    Repetition Buster does the opposite. It intentionally burns one throwaway chat and then starts another brand new one for the real request.

---

## :material-delete-clock-outline: Delete Chat After Reply

If you want GLM's chat history cleaned up automatically, IntenseRP can delete the completed GLM chat after a successful reply finishes.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Provider Behavior** -> **GLM Chat** -> **Delete Chat After Reply**

!!! warning "Slower requests"
    This adds extra cleanup work after each request, so it can slow requests down quite a bit.

!!! note "No Reuse Matching Chat here"
    This does **not** work together with **Reuse Matching Chat** or **Search Older Matching Chats**.

!!! tip "Repetition Buster still works"
    GLM's **Repetition Buster** is still compatible with this.

    IntenseRP deletes the temporary cache-buster chat too before it sends the real request.

---

## :material-key: Login notes (CAPTCHA)

GLM requires a CAPTCHA during login. Even with Auto Login enabled, you must complete the CAPTCHA in the browser window, since it's not really possible to reliably automate that step.

!!! tip "Use Persistent Sessions"
    Persistent Sessions are strongly recommended for GLM. They help you avoid solving the CAPTCHA on every start.

See: [:material-key: Login & Sessions](../features/login-sessions.md)

---

## :material-translate: UI language requirement

The GLM driver currently expects the GLM web UI language to be English (`en-US`). If GLM is set to another language, IntenseRP may fail to find buttons/toggles reliably.

If you see a warning about GLM UI language:

1. Change GLM language to **English (en-US)** in the GLM browser window
2. Reload the page (F5 / Ctrl+R)
3. Retry / restart the browser from IntenseRP if needed

---

## :material-code-tags: Per-message macros

You can add simple `[[...]]` macros to the *latest* user message in SillyTavern to override certain GLM Behavior settings for that request only.

All macros are stripped from the message before sending it to GLM.

| Macro | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `[[think]]`, `[[r1]]` | Force Deep Think on |
| `[[nothink]]`, `[[r0]]` | Force Deep Think off |
| `[[search]]` | Force Search on |
| `[[nosearch]]`, `[[no_search]]` | Force Search off |
| `[[tool]]`, `[[tools]]` | Force Tools on |
| `[[notool]]`, `[[notools]]`, `[[no_tool]]`, `[[no_tools]]` | Force Tools off |
| `[[file]]` | Force Send As Text File on |
| `[[nofile]]` | Force Send As Text File off |

!!! note "Search macros"
    Search macros like `[[search]]` / `[[nosearch]]` override the **Enable Search** setting for that request only.

!!! note "Tools macros"
    Tools macros only do anything on **GLM-5V-Turbo**. On unsupported GLM models, IntenseRP ignores the request and keeps Tools off.

!!! note "Scope"
    Only macros from the latest user message apply. They do not persist across requests.

## :material-wrench-clock: Quirks & Timing

GLM has a few quirks worth knowing about, that could look as broken (but really they can be pretty easy to work around). These are covered briefly on this page (see individual sections above), but if you want the full picture including all the timing knobs and workarounds:
